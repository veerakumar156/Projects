Create a thread safe collection that stores account balances.
There are 10,000 accounts with account numbers 1-10000.  All accounts have a 
starting balance of 1000.
Exercise this collection with this activity.
Create 3 threads:
1.	The debit thread will randomly choose an account and record a debit transaction with a 
random amount between 50-200.  Debits should occur 50 times per second.
2.	The credit thread will randomly choose an account and record a credit transaction with a 
random amount between 100-400.  Credits should occur 100 times per second.
3.	The analysis thread will calculate the account balance and average across all accounts 
every second.  No new transactions can be recorded while the analysis is taking place. 

The program will stop when the average balance in the accounts reaches 1100 or 2 minutes have 
passed.  When the program stops, find the account with the highest balance and print out the 
transaction history (record of all the debits and credits).
