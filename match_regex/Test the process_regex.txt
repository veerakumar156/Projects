The following are the key features or sections to be tested

1. Validate the input parameters
	a. Program is expected to print the correct form of usage if it is incorrectly used. 
	   Input:  python process_regex.py "123"
	   Expected output: 
				Usage:
								python process_regex.py <root_dir> <keyword>
								Examples : python process_regex.py "." ".*"
										 : python process_regex.py C:\Users\Public .*
				Requires two input arguments
				<root_dir> - directory in which the search should be done
				<keyword> - regular expression to be used for the search
	
	b. The program should have been written to handle the incorrect number of parameters and the type 
	   of parameters. The test should verify these cases. Program expects two inputs, root directory
	   and keyword. Hence, the test should cover if the program handles less or more than two inputs.
	   Input:  python process_regex.py "123"
	   Expected output: usage is printed
	
	c. The order of input parameters should also be verified. If the root directory is provided after 
	   the regular expression, the program should handle that. Similarly, any invalid or non-existent
	   directory names should be handled. 
	   Input:  python process_regex.py ".*" C:\Users\Danie\Documents\Veera\J
	   Expected output: Enter a valid directory name
	   
	d. When a invalid regular expression is provided, the program should specify the user to enter a valid 
	   regular expression. 
	   Input:  python process_regex.py "." "["
	   Expected output: Enter a valid regular expression


2. 	Test the basic output
	a. Create a few set of folders inside a subfolder. 
	b. Place the same file inside all the subfolders and the main folder
	c. Run the script and observe that the same number of matches are reported in all the different subfolders
	d. Repeat the above steps with different number of subfolders and different number of files in the root directory

3.  Observe that the application doesn't crash if run at the same time from multiple terminals.    
    
4.  Verify that the application is running in various operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Mac

5.  Verify that the application is not showing a plot if it did not find any regular expression matches in the search
